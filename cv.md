## Summary

The main goal that I set for myself when I enrolled in these courses is to structure my knowledge in the field of web development. The second goal is to accustom yourself to time management. A structural approach to the study of any issue and time management, I consider these two fundamental skills for developing me as a web developer in particular and a programmer in general.
